As said in the README file, some problems could already be solved with programs
I had already built.  Here is a list of said problems, of which I will not post
the answering programs because it seems useless:

- Problem 7   -> solved with prime_computer
- Problem 16  -> solved	with 2_pow_computer
- Problem 25  -> solved	with Fibonacci

All said programs can be found on my profile with the exact same name.
