As said in the README file,  while some problems are solved within milliseconds,
some of them might require more time. Remember some features take more time in C
than other languages!   Here is the FULL execution time for each of the problems
you will find in the repo (average of 10 executions if < 10 seconds):

- Problem 1   -> solved in 1.2 ms.
- Problem 2   -> solved in 1   ms.
- Problem 3   -> solved in 1.83 s.
- Problem 4   -> solved in 116 ms.
- Problem 5   -> solved in 65  ms.
- Problem 6   -> solved in 2.7 ms.

Just know I haven't tried to max them all out yet,    these scores might improve
when I go on to work on them again (and yes, I know they're not supposed to take
more than 60 seconds, but sometimes I just couldn't think of an other solution).
