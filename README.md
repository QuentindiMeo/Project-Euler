## :memo: Description

**Welcome to my Project Euler repository!**  

Here lie my programs to have successfully solved [**Project Euler**](http://projecteuler.net) problems in C.  
You may notice **libmy.a** at the root of this repository; it is a static library containing a variety of utility functions. Which of these functions that are used by each problem, is specified in their **my.h** file).

> [!TIP]  
> Because the <b>one-minute rule</b> may not always be respected, I put my program's execution times in [**prob_times.md**](/prob_times.md).

> [!WARNING]  
> Some of the solutions I didn't upload because they were easily solved by programs I had already made; problems solved by said programs are listed in [**prob_other.md**](/prob_other.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to report any bug or error concerning a solution by [**opening an issue**](https://github.com/QuentindiMeo/Project-Euler/issues).
  
*Who knows, maybe one day I'll make a huge unit testing file...*
