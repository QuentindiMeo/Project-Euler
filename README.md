Welcome to the Project Euler repository!<br/>
<br/>
Here lie my programs that successfully solved Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net) problems in C.<br/>
Because the <b>one-minute rule</b> may not always be respected, I put my program's execution times in 'prob_times.md'.<br/>
Some of the solutions I didn't upload because they were easily solved by programs I had already made; problems solved by said programs are listed in 'prob_other.md'.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Feel free to report any bug or error concerning a solution!</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Last factory check: May 4, 2022</i><br/>
<i>Who knows, maybe one day I'll make a big unit testing file...</i>
